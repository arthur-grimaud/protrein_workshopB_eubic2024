Participants will work with a dataset of synthetic phosphopeptides, covering all analysis steps from spectrum identification to the validation and scoring of phosphorylation sites. The results from the different approaches investigated will be compared to assess their respective limitations and advantages.\n",

In this paper, the authors compared three different fragmentation method (HCD, EThcD, and neutral-loss-triggered ET(ca/hc)D) with two analyzers for MS/MS (orbitrap (OT) and ion trap(IT)).
